# Minesweeper
## Summary
This is an ongoing project to recreate the classic game Minesweeper using Python. The first version uses a 2D list to randomly generate a 5x5 minefield, and the programme is able to detect how many mines are adjacent to a given square and return an integer accordingly. User input functionality to come shortly!
